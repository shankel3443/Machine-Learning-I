    "To measure a model's performance when predicting Grade classification, we will use an F1 score. We decided on this for a few reasons. First, there isn't a large difference in costs between a false negative and false positive. In the case of a false negative, customers will likely get a rental that exceeds their expectations. For a false positive, customers will have to deal with a worse rental than they might be expecting, but this rental could still has a passing review grade (70+). Additionally, the inbalanced class distribution (67% A's, 33% Non-A's) leads us to use F1 instead of plain accuracy due to F1's strength when dealing with unbalanced classes.\n",

    "To measure a model's performance when predicting Grade classification, we will use a sensitivity score. This is mainly due to the potential of a large negative costs for false positives.

    "#### Price\n",
    "To measure a model's performance when predicting Price, we will use mean absolute error (MAE). We chose this over MSE and RMSE for interpretability. With MSE, the scale of the error is boosted because of the square. While this is just as easy to use as MAE, keeping the scale consistent with Price is a nice benefit. For RMSE, the scale should be the same as Price and MAE. Therefore, we could realistically use either will no issues, but MAE won out simply because it's a simpler mathematical process."

Using stratification avoids this by holding these proportions constant across folds, leading to better training sets.\n",
