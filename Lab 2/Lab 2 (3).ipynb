    "OPTION A:\n",
    "To measure a model's performance when predicting Grade classification, we will use an F1 score. We decided on this for a few reasons. First, there isn't a large difference in costs between a false negative and false positive. In the case of a false negative, customers will likely get a rental that exceeds their expectations. For a false positive, customers will have to deal with a worse rental than they might be expecting, but this rental could still has a passing review grade (70+). Additionally, the inbalanced class distribution (67% A's, 33% Non-A's) leads us to use F1 instead of plain accuracy due to F1's strength when dealing with unbalanced classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "OPTION B:\n",
    "To measure a model's performance when predicting Grade classification, we will use a sensitivity score. This is mainly due to the potential of a large negative costs for false positives. When a rental is given a false positive prediction, customers could be dealing with a rental that drastically fails their expectations.\n",

    "To measure a model's performance when predicting Price, we will use mean absolute percent error (MAPE). This option works well because it preserves the scale of the data (as opposed to squaring the difference), and provides a percentage value that is easier to interpret than a dollar value."

When using our models we could figure out if a listing is overpriced for the area it is in or if it is a value find. With the rising costs of Airbnb's lately, and people turning back to using hotels, the owners of the rentals will want to ensure that their listings are generating revenue and not being ignored due to bad pricing. This will serve the owner of the property immensely, because having an extra mortgage that is not being subsidized by income from renters can prove to be quite perilous. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### What other data needs to be collected\n",
    "Since our model is pretty heavily aimed at price, I think a good data point that would need to be collected would be the neighborghood. The price of the listing would probably be closely correlated to the neighborhood. People will pay more/less to stay at a listing in certain neighborhoods, so our pricing model needs to be looked at in the confines of what neighborhood the listing is in. I.E accurate pricing within each neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "One other big data point I think we should capture is how often listings are actually being used (the % of listings that are being used/the total amount of listings available). New York for example often has weekends where more people are staying in rental properties (Fashion Week, Tennis' US Open, NYC marathon, Super Bowl, etc..). Weekends like this are bound to capture more out of towners seeking temporary housing accomodations. Having an increase in demand will allow listers of properties to be able to charge more money for their listings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How frequnetly should our data be updated\n",
    "Paying attention to real estate is always a very active endeavor. With the nature of real estate being what it is, I feel that our data would need to be updated weekly. However, when there is an anticipated rise in demand of properties like some of the example listed above, it would probably be a strong idea to update it on a daily basis. Having a accurate pricing point during these demand increases will allow the lister to feel that they are not losing out on potential money."
