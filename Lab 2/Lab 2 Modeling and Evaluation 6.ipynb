    "The highest feature with the highest magnitude of importance - this indicates that when a rental has more reviews per month, it is much more likely to get an overall rating or 90 or above (and A). This makes sense! More reviews means more bookings, and more bookings are much more likely if the past reviews are high instead of low.\n",

    "This has a fairly significant positive value. Again, this makes sense, as superhosts are likely to be more invested in their rentals, leading to higher review scores.\n",

    "***Minimumn Nights:***\n",
    "Some postulating here - a lower minimum nights value should give renters more flexibility. Making it easier for renters to book a short weekend stay. A lower miniumn night value would also make it possible for more renters to occupy the space in a short time period leading to a higher number of reviews per month.\n",
